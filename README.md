## Hey!
I have simplified certain elements while ensuring that it provides you with a comprehensive understanding of my skills. I have a preference for placing the majority of the logic on the backend, while keeping the frontend side to a minimum.
I'm open to discussing my work further and answering any questions you may have. So, let's talk!

### How to run all together
```
docker-compose --env-file .env up --build
```

Open 
```
http://localhost:3000/
```

### server integration tests
```
cd ./server
yarn && yarn test:int
```
